### Hey there, friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jonas (he/him), a frontend developer based in Heidelberg, Germany.

I started out quite design-focused in my studies of *digital media production*, then discovered software engineering and pivoted to that as my main focus â€“ partly through courses included in the study curriculum, partly through a separate [online study funded through a scholarship program by Google](https://www.polywork.com/jonaskuske/highlights/0a818906-9dff-4e92-8382-9c5a8ac5929e), but mostly through enthusiastic self-study: doing OSS work, creating passion projects, attending meetups and conferences and participating in hackathons.

Frontend development, which allows me to marry my passion for programming with my love for design, is where I feel right at home, but I also enjoy dabbling in other areas of development, such as DevOps and infrastructure work. I've since worked on various projects both [as a freelancer](https://helmerskuske.team) and working for [a software startup](https://www.msvhsoftware.de/). I enjoy contributing to major OSS projects like [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and maintain a couple [small-ish projects and libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smoothscroll-anchor-polyfill) myself.

You can also find me on other platforms like [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/jonaskuske), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JonasKuske), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonaskuske) or [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Jonas_Kuske). Feel free to reach out!
